## Mobile App Development

This project supports native iOS and Android app development using Capacitor.

### Prerequisites for Mobile Development:

**For iOS development:**
- macOS with Xcode installed
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

**For Android development:**
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK and emulator configured
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Mobile Development Commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for mobile platforms
npm run build:capacitor

# Sync with native platforms
npm run cap:sync

# Open in iOS (requires macOS/Xcode)
npm run cap:ios

# Open in Android (requires Android Studio)
npm run cap:android

# Run with live reload on iOS
npm run cap:serve

# Run with live reload on Android  
npm run cap:serve:android
```

### Adding New Platforms:

If you need to add platforms to an existing project:

```sh
# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios

# Add Android platform  
npx cap add android
```

### Native Features:

The app uses the following Capacitor plugins:
- **@capacitor/camera**: Native camera access for food photos
- **@capacitor/geolocation**: Precise location detection
- **@capacitor/device**: Platform detection and device info

### Platform-Specific Considerations:

- **Web**: Falls back to browser APIs (file input for camera, browser geolocation)
- **iOS**: Uses native camera and Core Location
- **Android**: Uses native camera and Android location services
